Heart Rate Prediction Model üî•
A powerful Machine Learning model designed to predict heart rates, developed for the AI Cure: Parsec 4.0 competition.

Overview
This model has undergone a meticulous development process, involving various stages to ensure accurate predictions and optimal performance.

Pre-Processing
Data preprocessing was a crucial step, involving the removal of redundant features, scaling the dataset, and separating labels for better model training.

Visualization
To gain insights into the dataset, we utilized visualization techniques. This includes histogram plots of feature vectors and a correlation heatmap, aiding in understanding the relationships within the data.

Feature Extraction
In the pursuit of efficiency, highly correlated features were removed, resulting in a reduction of features from 36 to 32 without compromising performance. Some features were averaged out, while others were directly removed.

Model Training
Multiple regression models were considered during the training phase, including Linear Regression (as a benchmark), RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, and LGBMRegressor. Initially, they were trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%. Further evaluation utilized K-fold cross-validation with k = 5, revealing the superior performance of the LGBMRegressor. We used Mean Squared Error (MSE) for evaluation.

Final Model
The final model was hyperparameter-tuned using random grid search to identify optimal parameters for the LGBMRegressor, ensuring the lowest MSE in heart rate predictions.
